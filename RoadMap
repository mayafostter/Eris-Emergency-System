# ERIS Emergency Response Intelligence System
## Product Roadmap 2025

> **Mission**: Building the world's first comprehensive AI-powered emergency response simulation platform to save lives through better preparedness.

---

## Project Overview

ERIS addresses a critical gap in emergency preparedness: there's no "staging environment" for disasters when millions of lives are on the line. Our platform deploys 10 concurrent AI agents to simulate complete disaster scenarios and test emergency coordination in real-time.

### Current System Architecture

**Live System**: [Dashboard](https://eris-emergency-system.vercel.app) | [API](https://eris-backend-621360763676.us-central1.run.app/docs) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mayafostter/Eris-Emergency-System)

**Core Components**:
- **10 AI Agents**: 6 Google ADK agents + 4 specialized agents
- **Real-time Coordination**: Gemini 2.0 Flash orchestration
- **Production Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run, Firestore, BigQuery
- **Modern Frontend**: React + TypeScript with WebSocket streaming
